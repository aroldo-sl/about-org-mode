* Welcome to Org mode

  Welcome, and thanks for trying out Org mode. Making outlines in
  Org is very simple. It is just text! Just start typing.
* This is a headline, it starts with one or more stars
  A heading has one star, a sub-heading two, etc.
* Working with lists
** Moving around headlines
** Moving around in our outline

*  Literature
** Lord of the Rings
   My favorite scenes are (in this order)
   1. The attack of the Rohirrim
   2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
      + this was already my favorite scene in the book
      + I really like Miranda Otto.
   3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
       - on DVD only
      He makes a really funny face when it happens.
   But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
   Important actors in this film are:
   - Elijah Wood :: He plays Frodo
   - Sean Austin :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
     him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in The Goonies.
