* org mode structure
  Text in org is structured by headings, denoted by lines starting
  with one or more * so we are currently in a section!

** subheading
Starts with an extra * and so on
** navigation
Heading can be expanded or collapsed by moving to the (sub)heading
and pressing TAB, S-TAB cycles all headings. You can jump to next and
previous headings with C-c C-n and C-c C-n respectively.

You can move headings up and down to reorder them with the arrow keys,
using M-up and M-down. You can change the level of the headings with M-left
and M-right (and use M-S-left and M-S-right to change the level of subheadings.)
